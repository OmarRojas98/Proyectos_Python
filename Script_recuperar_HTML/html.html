       13 meters. You should see it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mir 2, we're going over the bow.
       <br/>
       Stay with us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, quiet. We're rolling.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Seeing her coming out of the
       <br/>
       darkness like a ghost ship...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       still gets me every time.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To see the sad ruin of the
       <br/>
       great ship sitting here...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       where she landed at
       <br/>
       2:30 in the morning
       <br/>
       <br/>
       of April 15, 1912...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       after her long fall...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       from the world above.

       Dive 6. Here we are again
       <br/>
       on the deck of Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       21/2 miles down. 3,821 meters.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The pressure outside is
       <br/>
       31/2 tons per square inch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These windows are
       <br/>
       9 inches thick.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If they go, it's sayonara
       <br/>
       in two microseconds.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right, enough of that bullshit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just put her down on the roof of
       <br/>
       the officers' quarters like yesterday.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mir 2, we're landing right over the
       <br/>
       Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now.
       <br/>
       Go, Charlie.
       <br/>

       - All right, tether out.
       <br/>
       - Tether out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, Brock, we're dropping
       <br/>
       down along the hull.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down and go
       <br/>
       into the first class gangway door.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I want you guys working the D deck...

       Snoop Dog is on the move.
       <br/>
       We're headed down the stairwell.

       <br/>
       Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Okay, A deck.
       <br/>
       - Give me some rope, Captain.

       <br/>
       B deck. Get in there. Get in there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Watch the door frame.
       <br/>
       <br/>

       - I see it. I got it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - We good? Bring her down.
       <br/>
       - We're good. Just chill, boss.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, make your turn.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Cable out, Captain.
       <br/>
       - Make your turn. Watch the wall.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yeah Brock, we're at the piano.
       <br/>
       You copy?
       <br/>

       Okay, copy that.

       <br/>
       Okay, right there. Right there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, that's it, that's it.
       <br/>
       That's the bedroom door.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I see it. I see it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're in!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're in, baby. We're there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's Hockley's bed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's where the
       <br/>
       son of a bitch slept.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oops. Somebody left the water running.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold it. Hold it just a second.
       <br/>
       Go back to the right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That wardrobe door. Get closer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You smelling something, boss?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - I want to see what's under it.
       <br/>
       - Give me my hands, man.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Take it easy. It might come apart.
       <br/>
       - Okay.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go, go, go. Flip it over.
       <br/>
       Flip it over. Go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Turn her over. Keep going.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go, go, go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, drop it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, baby, baby.
       <br/>
       Are you seeing this, boss?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's payday, boys.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cha-ching!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - We did it, Bobby.
       <br/>
       - We brought it back, Baby.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, yeah! Who's the best?
       <br/>
       Who's the best, baby?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Say it. Say it. Say it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You are, Lewis.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Bobby, my cigar.
       <br/>
       - Right here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, crack her open.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No diamond.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know boss, this same thing happened
       <br/>
       to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Turn the camera off.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Brock, the partners would like
       <br/>
       to know how it's going.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't
       <br/>
       in the safe. But hey, hey...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't worry about it. There's still
       <br/>
       plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The floor debris in the suite,
       <br/>
       the mother's room...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the purser's safe on C deck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just going
       <br/>
       to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We've just got to go through a little
       <br/>
       process of elimination.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hang on a second.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Let me see that.
       <br/>
       - We may have something here, guys.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where's the photograph
       <br/>
       of the necklace?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We'll call you right back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll be goddamned.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
       <br/>
       is best known for finding Spanish gold...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach the
       <br/>
       most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He is with us live via satellite
       <br/>
       from the research ship Keldysh...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in the North Atlantic. Hello. Brock.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows
       <br/>
       the familiar stories of Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know, the nobility of the
       <br/>
       band playing to the very end and all that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.
       <br/>
       The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And we're out here using robot
       <br/>
       technology to go further into the wreck...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       than anybody has ever done before.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your expedition is at the center
       <br/>
       of a storm of controversy...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       over salvage rights and even ethics.
       <br/>
       Many are calling you a graverobber.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, nobody ever called the
       <br/>
       recovery of the artifacts...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What is it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Turn that up, dear.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I have museum-trained experts
       <br/>
       sent out here making sure...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       that these relics are preserved
       <br/>
       and catalogued properly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Take a look at this drawing
       <br/>
       that we found just today.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A piece of paper that's been underwater
       <br/>
       for 84 years.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And my team are able to
       <br/>
       preserve it intact.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Should this have remained unseen
       <br/>
       at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       when we can see and enjoy it now?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll be goddamned.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Brock!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's a satellite call for you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bobby, we're launching. You see
       <br/>
       these submersibles going in the water?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Trust me, buddy.
       <br/>
       You want to take this call.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This better be good.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, you gotta speak up.
       <br/>
       She's kind of old.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Great.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is Brock Lovett.
       <br/>
       How can I help you, Mrs...?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Calvert. Rose Calvert.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mrs. Calvert.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was just wondering if you had found...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the "Heart of the
       <br/>
       Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Told you you wanted to take the call.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right, you have my
       <br/>
       attention, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can you tell us who the woman
       <br/>
       in the picture is?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She's a goddamn liar!
       <br/>
       Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       God only knows why.
       <br/>
       Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They're inbound!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
       <br/>
       Titanic when she was 17, right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - That's right.
       <br/>
       - If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       101 next month.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look, I've already done the
       <br/>
       background on this woman...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       all the way back to the 20s,
       <br/>
       when she was working as an actress.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       An actress.
       <br/>
       There's your first clue, Sherlock.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
       <br/>
       Then she marries this guy named Calvert.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They move to Cedar Rapids
       <br/>
       and she punches out a couple of kids.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now Calvert's dead and, from what
       <br/>
       I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And everybody who knows about the
       <br/>
       diamond is supposed to be dead...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       or on this boat, but she knows.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hurry up, give him a hand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
       <br/>
       Welcome to the Keldysh.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, let's get her inside there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hi, Miss Calvert.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Hi.
       <br/>
       - Welcome to the Keldysh.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thanks.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hey!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Are your staterooms all right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Very nice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Have you met my
       <br/>
       granddaughter, Lizzy?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She takes care of me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We met just a few minutes ago.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Remember, Nana? Up on deck?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There. That's nice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Have to have my
       <br/>
       pictures when I travel.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can I get you anything?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is there anything you'd like?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I would like to see my drawing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Louis XVI wore a fabulous
       <br/>
       stone that was...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       called the Blue Diamond
       <br/>
       of the Crown...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       which disappeared in 1792...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       about the same time old Louis lost
       <br/>
       everything from the neck up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The theory goes that the
       <br/>
       crown diamond was chopped, too.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Recut into a heart-like shape that
       <br/>
       became known as...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the Heart of the Ocean.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Today it would be worth
       <br/>
       more than the Hope diamond.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I only wore it this once.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You actually think
       <br/>
       this is you, Nana?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is me, dear.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wasn't I a dish?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I tracked it down
       <br/>
       through insurance records.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       An old claim that was settled
       <br/>
       under terms of absolute secrecy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can you tell me who the
       <br/>
       claimant was, Rose?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I should imagine someone
       <br/>
       named Hockley.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Nathan Hockley, that's right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pittsburgh steel tycoon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The claim was for a
       <br/>
       diamond necklace his son...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Caledon, bought his fiancée.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A week before he
       <br/>
       sailed on Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And it was filed right
       <br/>
       after the sinking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So the diamond had to have
       <br/>
       gone down with the ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You see the date?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       April 14, 1912.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Which means if your grandmother
       <br/>
       is who she says she is...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       she was wearing the diamond
       <br/>
       the day the Titanic sank.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And that makes you
       <br/>
       my new best friend.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These are some of the things
       <br/>
       we recovered from your stateroom.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This was mine.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How extraordinary.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And it looks the same as it
       <br/>
       did the last time I saw it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The reflection has
       <br/>
       changed a bit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Are you ready to go
       <br/>
       back to Titanic?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, here we go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She hits the berg on
       <br/>
       the starboard side, right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She kind of bumps along...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       punching holes like
       <br/>
       morse code...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ditdit-dit... along the side...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       below the water line.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Then the forward compartments
       <br/>
       start to flood.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, as the water
       <br/>
       level rises...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       it spills over the
       <br/>
       watertight bulkheads...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       which, unfortunately, don't go
       <br/>
       any higher than E deck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So now as the bow goes down...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the stern rises up,
       <br/>
       slow at first...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       then faster and faster...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       until finally, she's got her whole
       <br/>
       ass sticking up in the air.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And that's a big ass.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're talking
       <br/>
       20, 30,000 tons. Okay?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And the hull's not designed
       <br/>
       to deal with that pressure.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, what happens?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She splits, right
       <br/>
       down to the keel.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And the stern...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       falls back level.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Then...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       as the bow sinks...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       it pulls the stern vertical...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and then finally detaches.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now the stern section just kind of bobs there
       <br/>
       like a cork for a couple of minutes...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       floods, and finally goes
       <br/>
       under about 2:20 AM...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2 hours and 40 minutes
       <br/>
       after the collision.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The bow section planes away...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       landing about a
       <br/>
       half a mile away...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       going 20, 30 knots when
       <br/>
       it hits the ocean floor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pretty cool?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you for that fine
       <br/>
       forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course, the
       <br/>
       experience of it was...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       somewhat different.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will you share it with us?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm taking her to rest.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, Nana.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Give me the tape recorder.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tell us, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's been 84 years...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's okay. Just try
       <br/>
       to remember anything...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       anything at all.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you want to hear this
       <br/>
       or not, Mr. Lovett?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's been 84 years...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and I can still smell
       <br/>
       the fresh paint.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The china had never been used.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The sheets had
       <br/>
       never been slept in.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Titanic was called
       <br/>
       the ship of dreams.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And it was.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It really was.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All third-class passengers...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       with a forward berth...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       this way please! This queue!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's a big boat?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Daddy, it's a ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't see what all
       <br/>
       the fuss is about.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It doesn't look any bigger
       <br/>
       than the Mauretania.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can be blasé
       <br/>
       about some things, Rose...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       but not about Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's over 100 feet longer
       <br/>
       than Mauretania...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and far more luxurious.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your daughter is far too
       <br/>
       difficult to impress, Ruth.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So this is the ship they
       <br/>
       say is unsinkable.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is unsinkable.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       God Himself
       <br/>
       could not sink this ship...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You have to check your baggage
       <br/>
       through the main terminal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's round that way, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I put my faith in you good sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now kindly see my man.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If I can do anything at all...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All the trunks from
       <br/>
       that car there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       12 from here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And the safe,
       <br/>
       to the parlor suite...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       rooms B-52, 54, 56.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ladies...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       we better hurry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come along.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - My coat?
       <br/>
       - I have it, miss.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All third-class passengers
       <br/>
       queue here for health inspection.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Welcome aboard, ma'am.
       <br/>
       - Welcome to Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It was the ship of dreams...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       to everyone else.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To me. It was a slave ship...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       taking me back to
       <br/>
       America in chains.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Outwardly, I was everything
       <br/>
       a well brought up girl should be.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Inside, I was screaming.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack, you are pazzo.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You bet everything we have.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When you got nothing,
       <br/>
       you got nothing to lose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sven?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right, moment of truth.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Someone's life is
       <br/>
       about to change.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fabrizio?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Niente.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Olaf?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Nothing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sven?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2 pair.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry, Fabrizio.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       you're not gonna see
       <br/>
       your mom again for a...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Long time...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       'cause we're going to America.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Full house, boys!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm going home!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm going home.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I go to America!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, mate.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Titanic go to America,
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in 5 minutes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shit. Fabri. Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, here. Here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're riding in high style now!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're a couple of
       <br/>
       regular swells.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're practically
       <br/>
       goddamn royalty...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ragazzo mio.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You see? Is my destino.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like I told you...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I go to America to
       <br/>
       be millionaire.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You are pazzo.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Maybe, but I've
       <br/>
       got the tickets.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, I thought
       <br/>
       you were fast.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Aspetta!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait! Wait!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hey, wait!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're passengers!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Have you been through
       <br/>
       the inspection queue?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Anyway, we don't have any lice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're Americans. Both of us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come aboard.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're the luckiest sons
       <br/>
       of bitches in the world.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know that?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good-bye!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know somebody?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course not.
       <br/>
       That's not the point.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good-bye! I'll miss you!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good-bye!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will never forget you!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come with me,
       <br/>
       darling. Let's go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G-60.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G-60. G-60.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Excuse me, ma'am.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       G-60.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, right here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hey, how you doing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack. Nice to meet you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How you doing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Who says you get top bunk?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is your private
       <br/>
       promenade deck, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will you be requiring anything?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Excuse me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - This one?
       <br/>
       - No.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It had a lot of faces on it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is the one.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Would you like all of
       <br/>
       them out, miss?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes. We need a little
       <br/>
       color in this room.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put in there. In the wardrobe.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       God, not those finger
       <br/>
       paintings again.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They certainly were a
       <br/>
       waste of money.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The difference between
       <br/>
       Cal's taste in art...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and mine is that I have some.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They're fascinating.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like being inside a dream
       <br/>
       or something.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's truth but no logic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - What's the artist's name?
       <br/>
       - Something Picasso.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Something Picasso.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He won't amount to a thing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He won't, trust me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
       <br/>
       - At least they were cheap.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put it in the wardrobe.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
       <br/>
       named Margaret Brown.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We all called her Molly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       History would call her
       <br/>
       the Unsinkable Molly Brown.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I wasn't about to
       <br/>
       wait all day for you, sonny.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here, if you think
       <br/>
       you can manage.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Her husband had struck gold
       <br/>
       someplace out west.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And she was what Mother
       <br/>
       called "new money."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       By the next afternoon...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       we were steaming west
       <br/>
       from the coast of Ireland...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       with nothing out ahead
       <br/>
       of us but ocean.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let's stretch her legs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Very good, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All ahead full.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All ahead full!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on lads, step lively!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right! Let's stoke
       <br/>
       her right up!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We go full ahead!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, put your
       <br/>
       backs into it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       21 knots, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hey, look, look, look!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       See it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's another one! See him?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look at that one!
       <br/>
       Look at him jump!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can see the Statue
       <br/>
       of Liberty already.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Very small, of course.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm the king of the world!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She is the largest moving object
       <br/>
       ever made by the hand of man...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in all history.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And our master shipbuilder,
       <br/>
       Mr. Andrews here...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       designed her from the
       <br/>
       keel plates up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I may have knocked
       <br/>
       her together, but...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the idea was Mr. Ismay's.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He envisioned a steamer
       <br/>
       so grand in scale...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and so luxurious in...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       its appointments...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       that its supremacy
       <br/>
       would never be challenged.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And here she is.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Willed into solid reality.
       <br/>
       - Hear, hear.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll have the salmon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know I don't
       <br/>
       like that, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She knows.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We'll both have the lamb.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rare, with very
       <br/>
       little mint sauce.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You like lamb, right sweet pea?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You gonna cut her meat
       <br/>
       for her too there, Cal?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hey, who thought of
       <br/>
       the name Titanic?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Was it you, Bruce?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, actually.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I wanted to convey sheer size.
       <br/>
       And size means stability...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       luxury, and above
       <br/>
       all, strength.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you know of
       <br/>
       Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His ideas about the male preoccupation with
       <br/>
       size might be of particular interest to you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What's gotten into you?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Excuse me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I do apologize.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She's a pistol, Cal.
       <br/>
       Hope you can handle her.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I may have to start minding what she
       <br/>
       reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Freud? Who is he?
       <br/>
       Is he a passenger?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The ship is nice?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yeah. It's an Irish ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is English, no?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, it was built in Ireland.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       15,000 Irishmen
       <br/>
       built this ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Solid as a rock.
       <br/>
       Big Irish hands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's typical.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       First-class dogs
       <br/>
       come down here to take a shite.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lets us know where we rank
       <br/>
       in the scheme of things.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like we could forget?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm Tommy Ryan.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Jack Dawson.
       <br/>
       - Fabrizio.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you make any money
       <br/>
       with your drawings?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Forget it, boyo.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You'd as like have angels fly out of
       <br/>
       your arse as get next to...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the likes of her.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I saw my whole life
       <br/>
       as if I'd already lived it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       An endless parade
       <br/>
       of parties and cotillions...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       yachts and polo matches.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Always the same narrow people,
       <br/>
       the same mindless chatter.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I felt like I was standing
       <br/>
       at a great precipice...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       with no one to pull me back.
       <br/>
       No one who cared...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       or even noticed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stay back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't come any closer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just give me your hand.
       <br/>
       I'll pull you back over.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No! Stay where you are.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I mean it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll let go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, you won't.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What do you mean, no I won't?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't presume to tell me
       <br/>
       what I will and will not do.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You don't know me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, you would have done it already.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're distracting me. Go away.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can't.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm involved now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You let go, and I'm going to have
       <br/>
       to jump in there after you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't be absurd.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - You'll be killed.
       <br/>
       - I'm a good swimmer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The fall alone will kill you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It would hurt. I'm not
       <br/>
       saying it wouldn't.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tell you the truth...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm a lot more concerned
       <br/>
       about that water being so cold.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How cold?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Freezing.
       <br/>
       Maybe a couple degrees over.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You ever...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       ever been to Wisconsin?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, they have some of
       <br/>
       the coldest winters around.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I grew up there,
       <br/>
       near Chippewa Falls.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I remember when I was a kid,
       <br/>
       me and my father, we went ice fishing...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       out on Lake Wissota.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ice fishing is, you know, where you...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know what ice fishing is!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You just seem like, you know,
       <br/>
       kind of an indoor girl.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Anyway, I...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       fell through some thin ice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I'm telling you...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       water that cold,
       <br/>
       <br/>
       like right down there...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       it hits you like 1000 knives
       <br/>
       stabbing you all over your body.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can't breathe.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can't think. Least not about
       <br/>
       anything but the pain.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Which is why I'm not looking
       <br/>
       forward to jumping in there after you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like I said...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't have a choice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
       <br/>
       come back over the rail and...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and get me off the hook here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're crazy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's what everybody says but...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       with all due respect, miss...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm not the one hanging off
       <br/>
       the back of a ship here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, give me your hand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You don't want to do this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm Jack Dawson.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose DeWitt Bukater.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll have to get you to
       <br/>
       write that one down.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I got you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Help, please!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Help!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Please, help me!
       <br/>
       - Listen. Listen to me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Listen. Listen to me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I've got you. I won't let go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now pull yourself up. Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I got you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What's all this?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You stand back and...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       don't move an inch!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fetch the Master at Arms.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is completely unacceptable!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What made you think that you could
       <br/>
       put your hands on my fiancée?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look at me, you filth!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What do you think
       <br/>
       you were doing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cal, stop. It was an accident.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       An accident?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It was.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stupid, really.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was leaning over and I slipped.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was leaning far over
       <br/>
       to see the...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Propellers?
       <br/>
       - Propellers, and I slipped.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I would have gone
       <br/>
       overboard but Mr. Dawson here...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       saved me. And almost
       <br/>
       went over himself.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You wanted to see the...
       <br/>
       She wanted to see the propellers.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like I said, women and
       <br/>
       machinery do not mix.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Was that the way of it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yeah. Yeah, that
       <br/>
       was pretty much it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, the boy's a hero then.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good for you, son. Well done.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, it's all's well and back
       <br/>
       to our brandy, eh?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look at you. You must be freezing.
       <br/>
       Let's get you inside.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Perhaps a little something
       <br/>
       for the boy?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Lovejoy,
       <br/>
       I think a 20 should do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is that the going rate
       <br/>
       for saving the woman you love?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose is displeased.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What to do?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Perhaps you could join us for
       <br/>
       dinner tomorrow evening...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       to regale our group...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       with your heroic tale.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sure. Count me in.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good. It's settled then.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This should be interesting.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can I bum a smoke?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You'll want to tie those.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's interesting...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the young lady slipped
       <br/>
       so suddenly...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and you still had time to remove
       <br/>
       your jacket and your shoes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know you've been melancholy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't pretend to know why.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I intended to save this...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       until the engagement
       <br/>
       gala next week...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       but, I thought...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       tonight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good gracious.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Perhaps as a reminder
       <br/>
       of my feelings for you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Is it a...
       <br/>
       - Diamond. Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       56 carats to be exact.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It was worn by Louis XVI.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And they called
       <br/>
       it Le Coeur de la Mer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - The Heart of the Ocean.
       <br/>
       - The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's overwhelming.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, it's for royalty.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are royalty, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know, there's
       <br/>
       nothing I couldn't give you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's nothing I'd deny you...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       if you would not deny me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Open your heart to me, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I've been on my own since
       <br/>
       I was 15, since my folks died.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I had no brothers or sisters or
       <br/>
       close kin in that part of the country...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       so I lit on out of there and I
       <br/>
       haven't been back since.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You could just call me a
       <br/>
       tumbleweed blowing in the wind.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
       <br/>
       around this boat deck and...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       chewed over how great the weather's
       <br/>
       been and how I grew up...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       but I reckon that's not why
       <br/>
       you came to talk to me, is it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Mr. Dawson, I...
       <br/>
       - Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I want to thank you
       <br/>
       for what you did.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not just for pulling me back,
       <br/>
       but for your discretion.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're welcome.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know what you
       <br/>
       must be thinking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Poor little rich girl.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What does she know about misery?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, that's not what I was thinking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What I was thinking was...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       what could have happened to this girl
       <br/>
       to make her think she had no way out?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well I...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It was everything.
       <br/>
       It was my whole world and...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       all the people in it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And the inertia of my life,
       <br/>
       plunging ahead and me...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       powerless to stop it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       God, look at that thing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You would have gone
       <br/>
       straight to the bottom.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       500 invitations have gone out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All of Philadelphia society will be there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And all the while I feel I'm...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       standing in the middle
       <br/>
       of a crowded room...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       screaming at the
       <br/>
       top of my lungs...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and no one even looks up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you love him?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pardon me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you love him?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're being very rude. You
       <br/>
       shouldn't be asking me this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, it's a simple question.
       <br/>
       Do you love the guy or not?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is not a suitable conversation.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why can't you just
       <br/>
       answer the question?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is absurd.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You don't know me
       <br/>
       and I don't know you...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and we are not having this
       <br/>
       conversation at all. You are rude...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and uncouth and presumptuous
       <br/>
       and I am leaving now...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack. Mr. Dawson.
       <br/>
       It's been a pleasure.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I sought you out to thank you
       <br/>
       and now I have thanked you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And you've insulted me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, you deserved it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Right.
       <br/>
       - Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I thought you were leaving.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I am.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You are so annoying.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't have to leave. This is
       <br/>
       my part of the ship. You leave.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, well, well.
       <br/>
       Now who's being rude?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What is this stupid thing
       <br/>
       you're carrying around?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, what are you,
       <br/>
       an artist or something?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These are rather good.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They're very good, actually.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack, this is exquisite work.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They didn't think too
       <br/>
       much of them in old Paree.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Paris?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You do get around for a p...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, a... a
       <br/>
       person of limited means.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, well, well.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And these were drawn from life?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, that's one of the
       <br/>
       good things about Paris.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lots of girls are willing
       <br/>
       to take their clothes off.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You liked this woman.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You used her several times.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She had beautiful
       <br/>
       hands, you see?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I think you must have
       <br/>
       had a love affair with her.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, no, no.
       <br/>
       Just with her hands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She was a
       <br/>
       one-legged prostitute.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       See?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She had a good
       <br/>
       sense of humor though.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, and this lady...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She used to sit at this bar every night...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       wearing every piece
       <br/>
       of jewelry she owned...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       just waiting for
       <br/>
       her long, lost love.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We called her Madame Bijoux.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, you have a gift, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You do.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You see people.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I see you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You wouldn't have jumped.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But the purpose of university
       <br/>
       is to find a suitable husband.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose has already done that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look, here comes that
       <br/>
       vulgar Brown woman.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Quickly, get up before
       <br/>
       she sits with us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello, girls. I was hoping
       <br/>
       I'd catch you at tea.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're awfully sorry,
       <br/>
       you missed it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Countess and I were just
       <br/>
       off to take the air on the boat deck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What a lovely idea.
       <br/>
       I need to catch up on my gossip.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Countess.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, you've not yet lit the
       <br/>
       last four boilers?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, I don't see the need.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are making excellent time.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The press knows the size of Titanic.
       <br/>
       Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We must give them
       <br/>
       something new to print.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This maiden voyage
       <br/>
       of Titanic must...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       make headlines.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
       <br/>
       not to push the engines...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       until they've been properly run in.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course I'm just a passenger.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I leave it to your good offices
       <br/>
       to decide what's best.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But what a glorious end
       <br/>
       to your final crossing...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       if we were to get into New York
       <br/>
       on Tuesday night...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and surprise them all.
       <br/>
       Make the morning papers.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Retire with a bang, eh, E. J?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good man.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       After that, I worked
       <br/>
       on a squid boat in Monterey...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       then I went to Los Angeles to the...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Santa Monica pier
       <br/>
       and did portraits for 10 cents each.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why can't I be like you?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just head out for the horizon
       <br/>
       whenever I feel like it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Say we'll go there
       <br/>
       sometime, to that pier...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       only if we just talk about it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ride on the roller coaster
       <br/>
       till we throw up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We'll ride horses on the
       <br/>
       beach, in the surf.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
       <br/>
       No sidesaddle stuff.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You mean with one leg on each side?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can you show me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sure, if you like.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Teach me to ride like a man.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Chew tobacco like a man.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And spit like a man.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You didn't learn in finishing school?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, I'll show you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll show you how.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I couldn't possibly, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Watch closely.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's disgusting.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your turn.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That was pitiful.
       <br/>
       You really have to hawk it back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get some leverage.
       <br/>
       Use your arms. Arc your neck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You see the range on that thing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That was better. You have to work on it.
       <br/>
       Really try to hawk it up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mother.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       May I introduce Jack Dawson?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Charmed, I'm sure.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The others were gracious and curious
       <br/>
       about the man who'd saved my life.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But my mother looked at him like an insect.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A dangerous insect
       <br/>
       which must be squashed quickly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sounds like you're a good man
       <br/>
       to have around in a sticky spot.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why do they always insist on announcing
       <br/>
       dinner like a damn cavalry charge?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shall we go dress, Mother?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       See you at dinner, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Son?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Son!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you have any idea what you're doing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not really.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're about to go into the snake pit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What are you going to wear?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I figured. Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was right. You and my son
       <br/>
       are just about the same size.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pretty close.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You shine up like a new penny.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good evening, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thousands of tons of Hockley steel
       <br/>
       are in this ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Which part?
       <br/>
       - All the right ones.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Then you're accountable
       <br/>
       if there's a problem. Where's Rose?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She'll be along.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There is the Countess.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I saw that in a nickelodeon
       <br/>
       and always wanted to do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Darling...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's amazing.
       <br/>
       You could almost pass for a gentleman.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Almost.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is extraordinary.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is a remarkable voyage.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Mad.
       <br/>
       - Completely lunatic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's the Countess of Rothes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's John Jacob Astor...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the richest man on board.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His little wifey, Madeleine,
       <br/>
       is my age and in a delicate condition.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       See how she tries to hide it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Quite the scandal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
       <br/>
       Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       is at home with the children, of course.
       <br/>
       And over here...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She designs naughty lingerie,
       <br/>
       among her many talents.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Very popular with the royals.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Congratulations. She's splendid.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why, thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Escort a lady to dinner?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Certainly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sweet pea, sweet pea.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ain't nothing to it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They love money. Pretend like you own
       <br/>
       a gold mine and you're in the club.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hey, Astor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       J.J., Madeleine,
       <br/>
       I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, Jack...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       are you of the Boston Dawsons?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He must have been nervous.
       <br/>
       But he never faltered.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They assumed he was one of them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       New money, obviously,
       <br/>
       but still a member of the club.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mother. Of course.
       <br/>
       Could always be counted upon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
       <br/>
       Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He was of help to my fiancée last night.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It happens Mr. Dawson
       <br/>
       is quite a fine artist.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He showed me some of his work today.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.
       <br/>
       Not to impugn your work, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Are all these mine?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Start from the outside and work in.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He knows every rivet in her.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How do you take your caviar, sir?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No caviar for me, thanks.
       <br/>
       Never did like it much.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       After that, I'm on God's good humor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How do you have means to travel?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I work my way from place to place.
       <br/>
       Tramp steamers and such.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I won my ticket on Titanic
       <br/>
       at a lucky hand at poker.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A very lucky hand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All life is a game of luck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A real man makes his own luck.
       <br/>
       Right, Dawson?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And you find
       <br/>
       that sort of rootless existence appealing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, ma'am, I do.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I've got everything I need
       <br/>
       right here with me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I have air in my lungs
       <br/>
       and blank sheets of paper.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I love waking up, not knowing
       <br/>
       what will happen or who I'll meet.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where I'll wind up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       now I'm on the grandest ship
       <br/>
       in the world, with you fine people.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll take more of that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Life's a gift. I don't
       <br/>
       intend on wasting it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You never know what hand you'll get dealt.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You take life as it comes at you.
       <br/>
       Here, Cal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Make each day count.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well said, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hear, hear.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To making it count.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bravo.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But Mr. Brown didn't know
       <br/>
       I'd hidden the money in the stove.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating
       <br/>
       and lights a fire.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Next is brandy in the smoking room.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now they retreat to congratulate each
       <br/>
       other on being masters of the universe.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ladies, thank you for your company.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       May I escort you to the cabin?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, I'll stay here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here, Molly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Joining us, Dawson?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You don't want to stay with the women.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, thanks. I have to head back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's best. It'll be all business and politics.
       <br/>
       Wouldn't interest you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But Dawson, good of you to come.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Must you go?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Time for me to row with the other slaves.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good night, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Want to go to a real party?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is okay I put my hand here?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can't understand you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm going to dance with her now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on. Come with me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack. Jack, wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can't do this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We'll have to get a bit closer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're still my best girl, Cora.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - I don't know the steps.
       <br/>
       - Me, either. Just go with it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't think.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What? Wait!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack, no.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Beyond the jurisdiction
       <br/>
       of the Sherman Act.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's what Rockefeller said...
       <br/>
       Supreme Court didn't swallow it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What? You think
       <br/>
       a first-class girl can't drink?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get out of here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Are you all right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm fine.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Two out of three.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       you think you're tough?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let's see you do this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jesus!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You okay?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I haven't done that in years.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, lads. Give it all you got.
       <br/>
       Let's go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Coffee, sir?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You didn't come to me last night.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was tired.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your exertions below deck
       <br/>
       were no doubt exhausting.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I see you had
       <br/>
       that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You will never behave like that again.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm not one of your mill foremen
       <br/>
       who you can command.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm your fiancée.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My fiancée. My fiancée!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, you are! And my wife!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My wife in practice,
       <br/>
       if not yet by law, so you will honor me!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You will honor me the way
       <br/>
       a wife honors her husband.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Because I will not be made a fool of.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is this in any way unclear?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good. Excuse me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, Miss Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We had a little accident.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - That's all right.
       <br/>
       - I'm sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let me help you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's all right, miss.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tea, Trudy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're not to see that boy again.
       <br/>
       You understand?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose, I forbid it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stop it, Mother.
       <br/>
       You'll give yourself a nosebleed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is not a game.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Our situation is precarious.
       <br/>
       You know the money's gone.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course I know.
       <br/>
       You remind me every day.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your father left us nothing but a legacy
       <br/>
       of bad debts hidden by a good name.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That name is the only card we have to play.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't understand you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is a fine match with Hockley.
       <br/>
       It will ensure our survival.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How can you put this on me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why are you being so selfish?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm being selfish?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you want to see me
       <br/>
       working as a seamstress?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is that what you want?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To see our fine things sold at auction?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Our memories scattered?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's so unfair.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course it's unfair.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're women.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Our choices are never easy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Protect them by Thy guiding hand
       <br/>
       <br/>
       From every peril on the land
       <br/>
       <br/>
       O, spirit whom the Father sent
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To spread abroad the firmament
       <br/>
       <br/>
       O, wind of heaven, by Thy might
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Save all who dare the eagle's flight
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And keep them by Thy watchful care...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello, Mr. Andrews.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I need to talk to someone.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're not supposed to be in here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was here last night, remember?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No. Now please turn around.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He'll tell you. I just need to talk...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       are still appreciative
       <br/>
       of your assistance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They asked me
       <br/>
       to give you this in gratitude...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't want your money.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And remind you you are
       <br/>
       in third class and your presence here...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       is no longer appropriate.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let me speak to Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
       <br/>
       returns to where he belongs...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and that he stays there?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come along, you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hear us when we cry to Thee
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For those in peril on the sea
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why are there two steering wheels?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We use this one near shore.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Excuse me, sir.
       <br/>
       Another ice warning, from the Noordam.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you, Sparks.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not to worry.
       <br/>
       Quite normal for this time of year.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In fact, we're speeding up.
       <br/>
       I've ordered the last boilers lit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, son, wind it up tight
       <br/>
       like I showed you. That's right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, now let it go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - It was good, wasn't it?
       <br/>
       - Quite nice. That's excellent.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Andrews... Forgive me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I did the sum in my head...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and with the number of lifeboats
       <br/>
       times the capacity you mentioned...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Forgive me, but it seems that there are
       <br/>
       not enough for everyone aboard.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       About half, actually.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose, you miss nothing, do you?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In fact, I put in these new
       <br/>
       type davits...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       which can take an extra row
       <br/>
       of boats inside this one.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But it was thought, by some...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the deck would look
       <br/>
       too cluttered.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, I was overruled.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's a waste of deck space
       <br/>
       as it is on an unsinkable ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sleep soundly, young Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I have built you a good ship,
       <br/>
       strong and true.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She's all the lifeboat
       <br/>
       you need.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just keep heading aft. The next
       <br/>
       stop will be the engine room.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack, this is impossible.
       <br/>
       I can't see you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - I need to talk to you.
       <br/>
       - No, Jack. No.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack. I'm engaged.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm marrying Cal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I love Cal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       you're no picnic. All right?
       <br/>
       You're a spoiled little brat even.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But under that, you're the
       <br/>
       most amazingly, astounding...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       wonderful girl...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       woman, that I've ever known.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack, I...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, let me try and get
       <br/>
       this out. You're ama...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm not an idiot.
       <br/>
       I know how the world works.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I've got ten bucks
       <br/>
       in my pocket.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I have nothing to offer
       <br/>
       you and I know that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I understand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But I'm too involved now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You jump, I jump. Remember?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can't turn away without
       <br/>
       knowing you'll be all right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's all that I want.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I'm fine.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll be fine. Really.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Really?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't think so.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They've got you trapped, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And you're gonna die if you
       <br/>
       don't break free.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Maybe not right away...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       because you're strong...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       but sooner or later that
       <br/>
       fire that I love about you, Rose...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       that fire is gonna burn out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's not up to you
       <br/>
       to save me, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Only you can do that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm going back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Leave me alone.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tell Lucile about the disaster
       <br/>
       you had with the stationers.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, of course the invitations
       <br/>
       had to be sent back, twice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, my dear.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And the dreadful
       <br/>
       bridesmaids' gowns.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let me tell you what an
       <br/>
       odyssey that has been.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose decided she
       <br/>
       wanted lavender.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She knows I detest the color.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So, she did it only to spite me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If only you'd come to
       <br/>
       me sooner.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ruth saw some of my designs in
       <br/>
       La Mode Illustrée.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They were for the trousseau of the Duchess
       <br/>
       of Marlborough's youngest daughter.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They were quite charming.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But, I think you'll agree,
       <br/>
       my dear, that together...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       we've created something
       <br/>
       of a phoenix from the ashes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I changed my mind.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They said you might be up here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Give me your hand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now close your eyes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, step up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, hold onto the railing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep your eyes closed.
       <br/>
       Don't peek.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm not.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, step up onto the rail.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold on. Hold on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep your eyes closed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you trust me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I trust you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       open your eyes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm flying.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come, Josephine, in my
       <br/>
       flying machine. Going up...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       she goes. Up she goes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That was the last time
       <br/>
       Titanic ever saw daylight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're up to dusk the
       <br/>
       night of the sinking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       6 hours to go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Incredible. There's Smith and
       <br/>
       he's standing there and...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       he's got the iceberg warning
       <br/>
       in his fucking hand...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       excuse me... his hand,
       <br/>
       and he's ordering more speed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       26 years of experience
       <br/>
       working against him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He figures anything big
       <br/>
       enough to sink, the ship...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       they're gonna see in time to turn.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But the ship's too big
       <br/>
       with too small a rudder.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Doesn't corner worth a damn.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Everything he knows is wrong.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's quite proper, I assure you.
       <br/>
       This is the sitting room.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Will this light do?
       <br/>
       - What?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't artists need good light?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That is true, but I'm not
       <br/>
       used to working in...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       such horrible conditions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Monet!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Do you know his work?
       <br/>
       - Of course.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look at his use of color here.
       <br/>
       Isn't he great?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know. It's extraordinary.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cal insists on carting
       <br/>
       this hideous thing everywhere.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Should we be expecting him
       <br/>
       any time soon?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not as long as the cigars
       <br/>
       and brandy hold out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's nice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What is it, a sapphire?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A diamond.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A very rare diamond.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack, I want you to draw me
       <br/>
       like one of your French girls.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wearing this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wearing only this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The last thing I need is another picture
       <br/>
       of me looking like a porcelain doll.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As a paying customer...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I expect to get what I want.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Over on the bed... the couch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come. Lie down.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Tell me when it looks right.
       <br/>
       - Keep that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put your arm back
       <br/>
       the way it was.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put that other arm up,
       <br/>
       that hand right by your face there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, head down.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Eyes to me. Keep them on me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And try to stay still.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So serious.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I believe you are blushing,
       <br/>
       Mr. Big Artiste.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can't imagine
       <br/>
       Monsieur Monet blushing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He does landscapes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Just relax your face.
       <br/>
       - Sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No laughing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My heart was pounding
       <br/>
       the whole time.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It was the most erotic
       <br/>
       moment of my life...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       up until then, at least.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So what happened next?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You mean, did we do it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack was very professional.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What are you doing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will you put this
       <br/>
       back in the safe for me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Gentlemen, would you excuse me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       None of the stewards
       <br/>
       have seen her.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is absurd. It's a ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's only so many
       <br/>
       places she could be.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lovejoy, find her.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Clear.
       <br/>
       - Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't think I've ever
       <br/>
       seen such a flat calm.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like a mill pond.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not a breath of wind.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It will make the bergs
       <br/>
       harder to see...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       with no breaking
       <br/>
       water at the base.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I'm off.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Maintain speed and
       <br/>
       heading, Mr. Lightoller.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's getting cold.
       <br/>
       You look nice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Miss Rose?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My drawings!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait, wait, wait!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Go. Go. Down, down.
       <br/>
       - Take us down, quickly. Quickly!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bye.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Keep going.
       <br/>
       - Thank you, I've got it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pretty tough for
       <br/>
       a valet, this fella.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Seems more like a cop.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I think he was.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Oh, shit.
       <br/>
       - Go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, over here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Quick!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now what?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       More coal for number one, mate.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold up? What are you two
       <br/>
       doing down here?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You shouldn't be down here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It could be dangerous!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Carry on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't mind us. You're
       <br/>
       doing a great job!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep up the good work!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look at what we have here?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where to, miss?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To the stars.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You nervous?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put your hands on me, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's bloody cold.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know, I can smell ice, you know.
       <br/>
       When it's near.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bollocks!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I can, all right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Did you ever find those
       <br/>
       binoculars for the lookouts?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Haven't seen them
       <br/>
       since Southampton.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I'll be on my rounds.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cheerio.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're trembling.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't worry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll be all right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - They ran down there.
       <br/>
       - Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Anything missing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I have a better idea.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Got you!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Did you see those guys' faces?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Did you see them?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When the ship docks...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm getting off with you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is crazy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know. It doesn't make any sense.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's why I trust it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here, look at this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look at that, would you?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They're warmer than we are.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If that's what it takes for us to get warm,
       <br/>
       I'd rather not.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bugger me!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pick up, you bastards!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is anyone there?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What do you see?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Iceberg, right ahead!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Iceberg ahead!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hard a' starboard!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Turn! Turn! Smartly!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Full astern!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hard over.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Helm's hard over, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go, lads, go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bring that steam down! Bring it down!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shut all the dampers! Shut them!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now! Engage reversing engine!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why ain't they turning?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is it hard over?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is, sir. Hard over.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, come on, come on. Turn.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's going to hit!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jesus Christ!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jesus!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hard to port!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let's go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They're closing the doors! Get out!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get out the door! Go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go! Go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Out! Out!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, my God.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That was a close shave.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Note the time. Enter it in the log.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What was that, Mr. Murdoch?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       An iceberg, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I put her hard to starboard,
       <br/>
       but it was too close.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I tried to port round it, but...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Close the watertight doors.
       <br/>
       - They're closed, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All stop.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Have the carpenter sound the ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, let's get the hell out of here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why have the engines stopped?
       <br/>
       I felt a shudder.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's the shudder you felt.
       <br/>
       Do you need anything?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's talk of an iceberg.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't see anything. Do you?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If this is where the rats
       <br/>
       are going, I am, too.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - You.
       <br/>
       - There is no emergency.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - There is. I've been robbed.
       <br/>
       - Get the Master at Arms.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, you moron!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Did I miss the fun?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Did you see what happened?
       <br/>
       - No. I guess it hit over there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Boiler room six is flooded eight feet
       <br/>
       and the mail hold is worse.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Can you shore up?
       <br/>
       - Not unless the pumps get ahead.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Have you seen the mail hold?
       <br/>
       - It's already underwater.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is bad.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We should tell Mother and Cal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I think they're very good, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't touch anything.
       <br/>
       I want the room photographed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We've been looking for you, miss.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here we go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Something serious has happened.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, it has.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Indeed.
       <br/>
       Two things dear to me have disappeared.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now that one is back,
       <br/>
       I know where to find the other. Search him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Take your coat off.
       <br/>
       - Now what?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What are you doing?
       <br/>
       We're in the middle of an emergency.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Is this it?
       <br/>
       - That's it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is horseshit!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't you believe it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - He couldn't have.
       <br/>
       - Easy enough for a professional.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was with him the entire time.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Perhaps he did it while you were putting
       <br/>
       your clothes back on, dear.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Real slick. They put it in my pocket.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Shut up.
       <br/>
       - It isn't even your pocket.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       "Property of A.L. Ryerson."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That was reported stolen.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I just borrowed it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, we have an honest thief.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know I didn't do this, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't believe them. You know it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let's go, son.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know I didn't do it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's a good lad. Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know I didn't do it! You know me!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is most unfortunate, Captain.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Water fourteen feet above the keel
       <br/>
       in ten minutes...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in the forepeak,
       <br/>
       all three holds and boiler room six.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When can we get underway?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's five compartments.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She can float with four compartments
       <br/>
       breached, but not five.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not five. As she goes down,
       <br/>
       the water will spill...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       over the tops of the bulkheads
       <br/>
       at E deck, one to the next...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       back and back. There's no stopping it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The pumps.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As of now, no matter what we do...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Titanic will founder.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But this ship can't sink.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And she will.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's a mathematical certainty.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How much time?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       An hour. Two, at most.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
       <br/>
       Mr. Ismay.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look at me when I'm talking to you!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Mr. Hockley?
       <br/>
       - Not now. We're busy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You've been asked to put on lifebelts
       <br/>
       and go to the boat deck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I said, not now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's
       <br/>
       Captain's orders. Dress warmly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's quite cold out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       May I suggest topcoats and hats?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is ridiculous.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not to worry, miss.
       <br/>
       I'm sure it's just a precaution.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Everybody up! Lifebelts on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What's he on about?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Put your lifebelts on!
       <br/>
       - What is it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just put them on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       C.Q. D?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sir?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's right, C.Q.D. The distress call.
       <br/>
       That's our position.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tell whoever responds we're going down
       <br/>
       and need immediate assistance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Blimey.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep lowering!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Uncover this boat! Uncover
       <br/>
       all the boats aft!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Release those ties!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Roll back that cover! Smartly now!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where are the passengers?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They went inside. Too
       <br/>
       cold and noisy for them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You there! Get down here
       <br/>
       and help with these lines!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Care for a drink, sir?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed
       <br/>
       up and now we're cooling our heels.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Nobody knows what's going on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just like the damn English...
       <br/>
       everything by the book.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No need for language, Mr. Hockley.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.
       <br/>
       I want a cup of tea when I return.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Andrews.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I saw the iceberg. And
       <br/>
       I see it in your eyes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please tell me the truth.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The ship will sink.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're certain?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In an hour or so, all this
       <br/>
       will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please, tell only who you must.
       <br/>
       I don't want to cause a panic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You remember what I told
       <br/>
       you about the boats?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I understand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Over here, son.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sir, there's a big mob
       <br/>
       at the Second Class Purser's office.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go on. I'll watch him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Aye. Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.
       <br/>
       Full steam for them, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She's the only one responding?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The only one close. They'll
       <br/>
       be here in four hours.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Four hours?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you, Bride.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My God.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are swung out and ready, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hadn't we better get the women and children
       <br/>
       into the boats?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Women and children first, yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Step this way, please. That's right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come towards me. Thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For the time being,
       <br/>
       I require only women and children.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Like the Captain said,
       <br/>
       nice and cheery, so there's no panic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       "Wedding Dance."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It isn't time to go to the boats yet!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please, stay calm.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Make sure you have your lifebelts on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let women and children
       <br/>
       through to the front.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What are we doing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Waiting. Once first-class people
       <br/>
       are in the boats...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       they'll start with us
       <br/>
       and we want to be ready.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pushing won't get you out any faster.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go get help.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lower it away, left and
       <br/>
       right together! Steady.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Both sides together! Steady!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Steady!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stop, stop, stop!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold the left!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right side only! Right side only!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right side!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold the left! Right side down!
       <br/>
       Lower away together!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Steady, lads!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know, I do believe this ship may sink.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I've been asked to give you
       <br/>
       this small token of our appreciation.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, sister, you heard
       <br/>
       the man. Into the boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Any room for a gentleman,
       <br/>
       gentlemen?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Only women at this time, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will the lifeboats be
       <br/>
       seated according to class?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I hope they're not too crowded.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, Mother, shut up!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't you understand?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The water is freezing and
       <br/>
       there aren't enough boats.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not enough by half.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Half the people on this
       <br/>
       ship are going to die.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not the better half.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       First class seats
       <br/>
       are right up here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You know, it's a pity I didn't
       <br/>
       keep that drawing.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It'll be worth a lot
       <br/>
       more by morning.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You unimaginable bastard.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, Rose darling.
       <br/>
       There's plenty of room for you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're next, darling.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come into the boat, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get into the boat!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good-bye, Mother.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where are you going?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To him?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To be a whore to a gutter rat?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'd rather be his whore
       <br/>
       than your wife.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I said, no!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose! Please, stop!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And, lower away!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, Wait!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lower away!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Rose!
       <br/>
       - Lower together!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold the left side!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Help!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can anybody hear me?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello! Help me!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Help me!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can you hear me?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can anybody hear me?!
       <br/>
       Somebody help me!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Andrews?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Steward, check the
       <br/>
       starboard corridor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Madame, please put on a lifebelt.
       <br/>
       Get to the boat deck immediately.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lucy, for God's sake put on your
       <br/>
       lifebelt and set a good example.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Anyone in here?
       <br/>
       - Mr. Andrews!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Andrews! Thank God!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where would the Master at Arms
       <br/>
       take someone under arrest?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What? You have to get
       <br/>
       to a boat right away.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm doing this with or
       <br/>
       without your help, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But without will take longer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Take the elevator to the
       <br/>
       very bottom. Go to the left...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       down the crewmen's passage.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Then go right and left
       <br/>
       again at the stairs.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You'll come to a long corridor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This could be bad.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Excuse me. Thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry, miss,
       <br/>
       but the lifts are closed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm through being polite,
       <br/>
       goddamnit!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now take me down!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       E deck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm going back up.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No! No! No!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come back! I'm going back up!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm going back up!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Crew passage.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose, I'm in here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm in here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack! I'm sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That guy Lovejoy put
       <br/>
       it in my pocket.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know, I know, I know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Listen Rose...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       you're gonna have to find
       <br/>
       the spare key, all right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Look in that
       <br/>
       cabinet right there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's a little silver one, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These are all brass ones!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Check right here, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       How did you find out I didn't do it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I didn't.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I just realized I already knew.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep looking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No key.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's no key!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right, Rose, listen.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're gonna have
       <br/>
       to go find some help.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It'll be all right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll be right back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll just wait here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello? Is there anyone here?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is there anybody down here?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We need help! Hello?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Damnit!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can anybody hear me, please?!
       <br/>
       Hello?! Hello?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, thank God.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait, please, I need your help.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's a man back
       <br/>
       here and he's...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Miss, you shouldn't
       <br/>
       be here now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I need your help.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There is a man down
       <br/>
       here and he is trapped.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - This way, yes. All right.
       <br/>
       - Please!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - There's no need to panic.
       <br/>
       - No, I'm not panicking!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're going the wrong way!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let go of me! Listen!!!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To hell with you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, my God.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will this work?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I guess we'll find out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait, wait, wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Try a couple practice
       <br/>
       swings over there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now try and hit the same mark
       <br/>
       again, Rose. You can do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, that's enough practice.
       <br/>
       Come on, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can do it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Listen, just hit it really hard
       <br/>
       and really fast.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on. Wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Open your
       <br/>
       hands up a little more.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Like that?
       <br/>
       - Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Listen, Rose, I trust you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You did it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on. Let's go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh shit, this is cold!
       <br/>
       Oh, shit!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shit! Shit!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is the way out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We have to find
       <br/>
       another way. Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pull.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put your backs into it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pull!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, there's something
       <br/>
       you don't see every day.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What's this luggage doing here?
       <br/>
       Get rid of it. Get rid of it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We need the room.
       <br/>
       Get rid of that. Out.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This way.
       <br/>
       Let go, sir. Get back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep calm!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lovejoy!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She's not on the starboard side either.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're running out of time. This strutting
       <br/>
       martinet isn't letting any men on at all.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's one on the other
       <br/>
       side letting men on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well then, that's our play.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We'll need some
       <br/>
       insurance first. Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This way, please.
       <br/>
       All the way down here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What do you think you're doing?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You'll have to pay for
       <br/>
       that, you know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's White Star
       <br/>
       Line property.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shut up!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will you hold the boat a moment?
       <br/>
       I just have to run back to my room...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sit down!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She's the last.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Prepare to lower.
       <br/>
       - Mr. Lightoller.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why are the boats being
       <br/>
       launched half full?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not now, Mr. Andrews.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There, look. 20 or so
       <br/>
       in a boat built for 65?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I saw one boat
       <br/>
       with only 12. 12!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, we weren't sure of
       <br/>
       the weight, Mr. Andrews.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These boats may buckle.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rubbish!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They were tested in Belfast
       <br/>
       with the weight of 70 men.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
       <br/>
       For God's sake man!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please, I need more women
       <br/>
       and children, please!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back in there!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is not an exit.
       <br/>
       This is not an exit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can't keep us locked in here.
       <br/>
       Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bring forward the women!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Unlock the gates.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Women only!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No men!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lock the gates!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get them back from those gates!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't touch the gates!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For God's sake, man...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       there are women and
       <br/>
       children down here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let us up so we can have a chance!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Tommy!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Can we get out?
       <br/>
       - It's hopeless that way.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Whatever we do,
       <br/>
       we've got to do it fast.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The boats are all going.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This whole place is flooding.
       <br/>
       We've gotta get out of here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There is niente this way.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let's go this way, all right?
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I make my own luck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So do I.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, come on, let's go this way.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This way!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just go back to
       <br/>
       the main stairwell.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And everything will be
       <br/>
       sorted out there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It will all get sorted out back there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go back to the main stairwell.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Open the gate!
       <br/>
       - Go back down the main stairwell.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Open the gate right now!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go back down the main
       <br/>
       stairwell, like I told you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stop that!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fabri, Tommy,
       <br/>
       give me a hand here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Move aside.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, pull!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pull!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Move aside.
       <br/>
       Quickly, move aside!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put that down!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Move aside!
       <br/>
       - Put that down!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One! Two!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Three!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Again!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, let's go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let's go, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You can't go up there!
       <br/>
       You can't do this!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep order! Keep order here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Back! Back! Back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold on to her!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pull her in!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back, I say, or I'll...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       shoot you all like dogs!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep order here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep order, I say.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Lowe, man this boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right. Is everybody all right?
       <br/>
       Nobody panic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stay back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're too late.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There are more boats down the front.
       <br/>
       Stay with this one. Murdoch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He seems to be quite practical.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't lower it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cut the falls!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sit down!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stay back, you lot!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Just stay back, the
       <br/>
       lot of you! Stay back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's starting to fall apart.
       <br/>
       We don't have much time.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Murdoch?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Hockley.
       <br/>
       You two, with me, now!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm a businessman, as you know...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and I have a business
       <br/>
       proposition for you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The boats are gone!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Colonel, are there
       <br/>
       any boats on that side?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, miss, but there are a couple
       <br/>
       of boats all the way forward.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This way, I'll lead you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What's the use?
       <br/>
       Nobody's listening to us anyway.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, they don't listen to
       <br/>
       us at dinner, either.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, let's play.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep us warm.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       "Orpheus."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Music to drown by.
       <br/>
       Now I know I'm in first class.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Where is everyone?
       <br/>
       - They're all still aft, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We have an understanding
       <br/>
       then, Mr. Murdoch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will the men please hold
       <br/>
       back! Hold back, I say!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Women and children only!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come through, madame.
       <br/>
       This way. Step back, sir!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You better check the
       <br/>
       other side. Go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I found her, on the other side.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Waiting for a boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       With him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Any more women and children?
       <br/>
       - They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Anyone else then?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Anyone else?
       <br/>
       - Do hurry. Hurry along.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Goddamn it all to hell.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Shit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fire!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sir, sir, you can't
       <br/>
       go through here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's it. Splendid. Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Prepare to lower.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ready on the left.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Take them down.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep it steady.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Both sides together.
       <br/>
       Steady. Keep it steady.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Give her to me.
       <br/>
       - Daddy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It'll be fine, darling.
       <br/>
       Don't you worry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Daddy, get in the boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's good-bye for a little
       <br/>
       while. Only for a little while.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There'll be another
       <br/>
       boat for the daddies.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This boat is for the
       <br/>
       mummies and the children.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You hold Mummy's hand
       <br/>
       and be a good little girl.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm not going without you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, you have to go, now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get in the boat, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get on the boat!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yes, get on the boat, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh my God, look at you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You look a fright.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Put this on. Come.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go on. I'll get the next one.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, not without you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll be all right.
       <br/>
       Listen, I'll be fine.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm a survivor, all right?
       <br/>
       Don't worry about me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, go on. Get on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I have an arrangement with an
       <br/>
       officer on the other side of the ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack and I can get off safely.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Both of us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       See?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I got my own boat to catch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go on, hurry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They're almost full.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Step aboard, miss.
       <br/>
       - Go. Go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Step aboard, please.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're daddy's
       <br/>
       good girl, all right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're my little sailor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Clear the rail, please.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And, lower away!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're a good liar.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Almost as good as you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's no... there's no
       <br/>
       arrangement, is there?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, there is.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not that you'll benefit much from it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I always win, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One way or another.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stop her!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose, what are you doing?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose! You're so stupid!
       <br/>
       Why did you do that?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're so stupid, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Why did you do that? Why?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You jump, I jump, right?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh God. I couldn't go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I couldn't go, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's all right. We'll
       <br/>
       think of something.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - At least I'm with you.
       <br/>
       - We'll think of something.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on! Move!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on! Move.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Move!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on! Come on Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose, come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Move Rose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I hope you enjoy your time together!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What could possibly be funny?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I put the diamond in the coat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I put the coat on her!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Dada!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We can't leave him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All right, come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Dada!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's the wrong way! Come back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, not that way!
       <br/>
       Come back! Stop!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go! Run!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This way!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Give me your hand!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, God!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Help!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait, sir!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sir, open the gate, please!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Help us, please!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Help us!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Please!
       <br/>
       - Please!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bloody hell!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Come on, come on!
       <br/>
       - Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go, go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jesus.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Please!
       <br/>
       - Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hurry!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Wait, please!
       <br/>
       - Wait!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't leave! Please,
       <br/>
       send for help!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I got it! Which
       <br/>
       one is it, Rose?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The short one.
       <br/>
       Try the short one.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hurry, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh no! It won't go in.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hurry, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's stuck! It's stuck!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Come on!
       <br/>
       - Hurry, Jack!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Hurry, Jack!
       <br/>
       - Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I got it! I got it!
       <br/>
       Go! Go, Rose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go! Go!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack! Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Move, move.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Get those oars in place.
       <br/>
       - Get an oar under it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold it! Hold it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get these davits cranked in!
       <br/>
       Let's get the falls hooked up!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mommy!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep going up!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stop pushing!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stay back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Will you give us a chance
       <br/>
       to live, you limey bastard!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll shoot any man who tries
       <br/>
       to get past me! Get back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bastard!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We had a deal, damn you!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your money can't save you
       <br/>
       any more than it could save me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Women and children only!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, Tommy!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, Will!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now stand back, damn you!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I have a child!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - I have a child!
       <br/>
       - Clear a path here!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please, I have a child!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please. I'm all she has in the world.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Go on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Step back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Please?
       <br/>
       - Here, give her to me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're all right, dearie.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Give her here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There, there.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Won't you even
       <br/>
       make a try for it?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry that I didn't build you
       <br/>
       a stronger ship, young Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's going fast.
       <br/>
       We have to move.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good luck to you, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And to you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Mr. Guggenheim?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are dressed in our best and are
       <br/>
       prepared to go down as gentlemen.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But we would like a brandy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get the falls over here now!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let them drop. Then we'll right it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Capitán?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Capitán, where should I go? Please.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Captain. Captain. Sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right. That's it, then.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Good-bye, Wally. Good luck.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - Good-bye, Wallace.
       <br/>
       - So long, old chap.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And so they lived happily
       <br/>
       together for 300 years...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in the land of Tir na nog...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Land of eternal
       <br/>
       youth and beauty.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's no time!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cut those falls!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cut them!
       <br/>
       Cut them if you have to!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I need a knife!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cut the falls now!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cut them loose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Cut those bloody falls!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Gentlemen...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       it has been a privilege
       <br/>
       playing with you tonight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We have to stay on the
       <br/>
       ship as long as possible.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This way. Through the rail.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jump.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I got you. Jump.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I've got you, miss.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No! You'll swamp us!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yea, though I walk through the
       <br/>
       valley of the shadow of death...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You wanna walk a little faster
       <br/>
       through that valley there?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Holy Mary, mother of God...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       pray for us sinners now and
       <br/>
       at the hour of our death. Amen.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hail Mary, full of grace...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This way.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I saw a new heaven
       <br/>
       and a new earth...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       for the first heaven and the first earth
       <br/>
       had passed away...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and there was no more sea.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It'll be over soon.
       <br/>
       It'll all be over soon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And He shall dwell with them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And they shall be His people
       <br/>
       and God Himself shall be with them...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and be their God.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       this is where we first met.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And God shall wipe away
       <br/>
       all the tears from their eyes...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and there shall be
       <br/>
       no more death.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Neither shall there be
       <br/>
       sorrow or crying.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Neither shall there
       <br/>
       be any more pain...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       for the former world
       <br/>
       has passed away.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bloody pull faster! And pull!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hang on, miss Trudy!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold on real tight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       God Almighty.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep those breakers in!
       <br/>
       Keep them in!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We have to move!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Give me your hand.
       <br/>
       I'll pull you over.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can't.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Give me your hand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I've got you. I won't let go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, I've got you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       - What's happening, Jack?
       <br/>
       - I don't know. I don't know.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This is it!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, my God, Jack!
       <br/>
       Oh, God. Oh, God.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold on!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The ship is gonna suck us down.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Take a deep breath when I say.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Kick for the surface
       <br/>
       and keep kicking.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do not let go of my hand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're going to make it, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Trust me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I trust you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ready! Ready!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack! Jack!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get off her! Get off her!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep swimming.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's so cold.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Swim, Rose!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep swimming.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       get on it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get on top.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It'll be all right now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Return...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the boats!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The boats are coming
       <br/>
       back for us Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hold on just a
       <br/>
       little bit longer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They had to row
       <br/>
       away for the suction...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       but now they'll be coming back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For God's sake!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Please...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       help us!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You don't understand.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If we go back, they'll
       <br/>
       swamp the boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They'll pull us right down,
       <br/>
       I'm telling you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oh, knock it off.
       <br/>
       You're scaring me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come on, girls, grab
       <br/>
       an oar. Let's go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Are you out of your mind?
       <br/>
       We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, do you people want to live
       <br/>
       or do you want to die?!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't understand a one of you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What's the matter with you?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's your men out there!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's plenty of room for more.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And there'll be one less
       <br/>
       on this boat...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       if you don't shut that
       <br/>
       hole in your face!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, bring in your oars over there.
       <br/>
       And tie these boats together as well.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, make sure that's
       <br/>
       tied up nice and tight.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right, listen to me, men.
       <br/>
       We have to go back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I want to transfer all the women
       <br/>
       from this boat into that boat right now...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       as quick as you can, please.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let's create some space over there.
       <br/>
       Move forward and aft.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's getting quiet.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's just going to take a
       <br/>
       couple of minutes...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       to get the boats organized.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't know about you but...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I intend to write
       <br/>
       a strongly worded letter...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       to the White Star Line
       <br/>
       about all this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I love you, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't you do that.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't you say your
       <br/>
       good-byes. Not yet.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you understand me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm so cold.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Listen, Rose...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       you're gonna get out of here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're gonna go on...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and you're gonna
       <br/>
       make lots of babies.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And you're gonna
       <br/>
       watch them grow.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You're gonna die an old...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       an old lady.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Warm in her bed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not this night. Not like this.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you understand me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can't feel my body.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Winning that ticket, Rose...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       was the best thing that
       <br/>
       ever happened to me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It brought me to you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I'm thankful
       <br/>
       for that, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm thankful.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You must...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       you must do me this honor.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       You must promise me
       <br/>
       that you'll survive.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That you won't give up...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       no matter what happens.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No matter how hopeless.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Promise me now, Rose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And never let go
       <br/>
       of that promise.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I promise.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Never let go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll never let go, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll never let go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Right ahead, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oars!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Do you see any moving?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, sir. None moving, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Check them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Bring that oar up here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Check them. Make sure.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These are dead, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, give way.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Ahead easy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Careful with your oars.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't hit them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is there anyone
       <br/>
       alive out there?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can anyone hear me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is there anyone
       <br/>
       alive out there?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We waited too long.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Well, keep checking them!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keep looking!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Is there anyone
       <br/>
       alive out there?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can anyone hear me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come, Josephine...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in my flying machine
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And it's up she goes
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Up she goes
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come, Josephine...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in my flying...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's a boat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's a boat, Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come back. Come back!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Hello!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can anyone hear me?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's nothing here, sir.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'll never let go.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I promise.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Come about!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Fifteen hundred people
       <br/>
       went into the sea...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       when Titanic
       <br/>
       sank from under us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There were twenty
       <br/>
       boats floating nearby...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and only one came back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Six were saved
       <br/>
       from the water...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       myself included.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Six...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       out of fifteen hundred.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Afterward...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       the seven hundred
       <br/>
       people in the boats...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       had nothing to do but wait.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait to die.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait to live.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Wait for an absolution...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       that would never come.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Sir, I don't think you'll find any
       <br/>
       of your people down here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It's all steerage.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His hair is reddish brown,
       <br/>
       reddish brown, reddish brown.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       White beard.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Isn't there another
       <br/>
       passenger list?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There is no other list.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Perhaps he's on another ship.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We're doing all we can,
       <br/>
       ma'am. I'm so sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That's the last time
       <br/>
       I ever saw him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He married. Of course.
       <br/>
       And inherited his millions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But the Crash of '29 hit
       <br/>
       his interests hard...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and he put a pistol in
       <br/>
       his mouth that year.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Or so I read.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Can I take your name
       <br/>
       please, love?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Dawson.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Rose Dawson.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thank you.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We never found
       <br/>
       anything on Jack.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There's no record
       <br/>
       of him at all.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No, there wouldn't
       <br/>
       be, would there?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And I've never spoken
       <br/>
       of him until now.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not to anyone.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not even your grandfather.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A woman's heart is a
       <br/>
       deep ocean of secrets.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But now you know there was
       <br/>
       a man named Jack Dawson...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       and that he saved me...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       in every way that
       <br/>
       a person can be saved.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I don't even have
       <br/>
       a picture of him.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He exists now only
       <br/>
       in my memory.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Keldysh, Mir 2 on our
       <br/>
       way to the surface.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was saving this for when
       <br/>
       I found the diamond.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm sorry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Three years...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I've thought of
       <br/>
       nothing except Titanic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But I never got it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I never let it in.
